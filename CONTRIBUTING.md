1. Clone the repository into the approriate directory. Ensure that it is in the [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH)
2. Call `dep ensure` to install dependencies. See `dep` documentation for more information
3. `go build`!

### Testing

Testing this is difficult without a live instance of Nelson. Integration tests and ideas are welcome!
